## Introduction

The **Signature Recognizer** aims to leverage deep learning and image processing techniques to identify and verify signatures. This project will utilize libraries such as PyTorch, NumPy, and others to build a robust model for signature recognition.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required libraries. Here‚Äôs how to do it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ohyeasabhi/signature-recognizer.git
cd signature-recognizer
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. 

### Requirements

You will need the following libraries:

- Google Colab
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Pandas
- PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- Scikit-image
- TIMM
- Torchvision

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install google-colab matplotlib numpy pandas torch scikit-learn scikit-image timm torchvision
```

## Usage

To use the Signature Recognizer, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset of signatures. Ensure that the images are in a format supported by the project (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
2. Open the Jupyter notebook provided in the repository.
3. Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data and train the model.

For detailed instructions, please refer to the [notebook documentation](https://github.com/ohyeasabhi/signature-recognizer/releases).
